<h4><center>A look into the University Faculty API</center></h4>
</div>

<div class = "introsection">
<h2>Starting point</h2>

<p>The API can be accessed through this given starting URI <a href="http://comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk/modules/15">http://comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk/modules/15</a>, which links to a resource of a module in the API.
    From here we can explore the API and the rest of the endpoints located inside it.

</p>

<div>
    <h2>General URI Format</h2>
    <p>Each URI has a commonly shared structure which is made of multiple sections:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each URI specifies the http <b>protocol</b> at the beginning of the URI as 'http://', which is the protocol used to access the resources in the API.</li>
        <li>The <b>domain</b> of the URI is comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk, which identifies the host origin server for the API</li>
        <li>The <b>path</b> comes next after the general root URI 'http://comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk', and is designated through a series of '/' characters and keywords e.g /modules/15 </li>
        <li>Finally a <b>resource identifier</b> can be used at the end to locate a specific resource e.g modules/15 has the identifier '15'</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For the example URI <b><span style="color:rgb(82, 82, 16)">http://</span><span style="color:rgb(11, 60, 80)">comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk</span><span style="color:rgb(65, 10, 40)">/modules/</span><span style="color:rgb(10, 65, 17)">15</span></b>, its individual parts have been colour coded. 
        Here we can see it specifies the 'http' protocol, identifies the origin server at 'comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk' and follows a path of /modules/ and specifies module resource located at identifier '15'.</p>

    PATCH does not require any fields to be present in the request body, but it still retains the same constraints to the fields that are included as PUT (Which is given in the body of an OPTIONS request), such as the semester field data having an integer value between 1 and 2.
If these constraints are not met, the server will respond with a 400 Bad request code, and no data will be changed in the resource. The response body will also include an error message, for example saying "A valid integer is required" if the semester field is entered as a string "two".</p>

<p>Using the delete method allows you to send a request to delete one of the modules listed. If the server accepts your authentication, the module is removed from the server and a <b>203 No Content Message</b> is returned. The server will keep processing the delete method until it times out.</p>
<br>
<p>If no authentication header is added to the delete request, a <b>401 Unauthorised</b> Response code is returned and the module does not get deleted.

<p>Using the OPTIONS method returns the formats of the representations stored in the API Server, which are in JSON, XML and CSV, and a <b>200 OK</b> response if the call is successful.

<h5>Options Response with valid Authorisation</h5>

<img src="images/putValMod.PNG" alt="The body returned by the OPTIONS request with Authentication">

<p>If correct authorisation is provided the options body also includes extra information for a put command that adds some constraints to what can be included in the body of a PUT request.
    For example, for the url field it is set so it can only be read and not modified, so the client cannot choose the location of where the module is stored.
     It also gives the types allowed, such as only integers for the year or any value for the url. Each field has a descriptive label, and some fields are required to be inside the PUT request body, such as name, code and faculty.
     Some fields have restraints on the values they take, for instance with the semester field, it can only take integers between 1 and 2. 
     If these constraints are not fulfilled in the PUT request, it will not be successful and return a <b>400 Bad Request</b> response.

<p>The POST method allows the client to send a request to create a new URI in the web server. For the request to be successful,

<p>If used on the URI <a href="http://comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk/faculties">http://comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk/faculties</a>, the server will provide a representation of a list of all the faculties spanning across all valid URLS 'http://comp3227.ecs.soton.ac.uk/faculties/{Faculty id}' as a single representation. </p>

    <h3>Representation Format</h3>
    <p>The formats allowed for the returned representation are in JSON, XML and a CSV Text table, which can be requested for through an Allow Header in the request headers.
         The default representation given by the server is in JSON format.
         If the client requests a representation not stored by the server, e.g ecmascript, then the server responds with a <b>406 Not Acceptable</b> Response code, and details in the response body that
        the server could not satisfy the request Accept Header.</p>
